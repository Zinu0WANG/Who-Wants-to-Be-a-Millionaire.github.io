# Who-Wants-to-Be-a-Millionaire

This project allows you to play a “Who wants to Be a Millionaire” Game. This user manual will guide you through the process of setting up the game and provide instructions on how to play. The game consists of 9 questions, and depending on your choices, you can win a prize or lose it all. Let’s get started!
Click enter to start the game, use the up, down, left, and right buttons to control the player to move up, down, left, right. You can select options by moving characters to options. If the correct option is selected, you can choose whether to continue with the next question or end the game. If selected incorrectly, all bonuses will be lost. You have 60 seconds to answer each question. If you do not answer within 60 seconds, you will fail and lose all bonuses.
At the same time, you can also choose to use the toolbox when you encounter a problem you don't know. There are two tools in the toolbox. You can use tool A to randomly eliminate an incorrect answer, or use tool B to ask the audience the question, and they will tell you an answer, but its probability of being correct is only 64%. Attention! There is only one chance to use the toolbox in a game! Please use it wisely!
